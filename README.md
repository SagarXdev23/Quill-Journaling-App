# Quill-Journaling-App
A clean and minimal journaling web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to register, log in, and create journal entries with categories like ideas, goals, tasks, and memories. The app features a responsive design, elegant typography, and a simple UI with a chat popup (coming soon).
